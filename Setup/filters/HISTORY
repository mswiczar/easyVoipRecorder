I first began working on ogg media directshow filters whilst 
under contract to CSIRO's annodex.net project group. 
Much of the knowledge I needed to write these filters was 
gained through my work with this project.

My initial implementation was for a specific annodex 
(which uses the ogg encapsulation format)demuxer. 
Part of my aim of this project was to use the knowledge 
gained to create a set of filters that works with generic
ogg physical streams rather than just a particular physical 
bitstream format and to release these back to the open source 
community. There were several limitations to the approach 
taken to the original annodex filters which is why I decided 
to start from scratch to design the filter architecture over
again with the experience of the first attempt.

Another of my aims of this project is to rewrite the annodex
demuxer to use this new design in order for it to be more
extensible and easier to work with. This time writing the
generic ogg case first and then basing the annodex demuxer
on this new design it will increase the consistency of the
code between the two modules and provide less trouble
integrating new codecs, with the aim of making annodex
technology available in the standard applications that
come default with windows.

I encourage you all to go and check out the annodex project
and to consider coding some applications to utilise this new
technology. There are many interesting posibilities this new
technology presents to continuous media and search technology
which will expand the internet to be a richer more dynamic
multimedia experience.

Thankyou to CSIRO's annodex.net project group
(Silvia Pfeiffer, Conrad Parker and André Pang) for the 
opportunity to work on this exciting new technology and 
sparking my interest in directshow and the xiph.org 
range of codecs.
